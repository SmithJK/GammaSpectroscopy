## Coding - To Do
1. ~~set \alpha = 0 for toy system~~
2. ~~manually compute **A**, **B**, **N**, **M**, **S** to make sure the code works~~
3. ~~make sure summing works properly, find termination point~~ --> matrix ends when _k=4_ (at most)
4. evaluate matrices with no summing (use Gilmore as a reference)
5. find way to read in a text file efficiently

## Writing/Research - To Do
1. read Knoll 2.3, 10.0-3(e)
2. write as much as possible!
3. find physical meanings of **c, e, a, b**
